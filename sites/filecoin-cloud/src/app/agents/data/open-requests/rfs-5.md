# Fee-Gated Agent Communication Protocol

## Concept

A secure, peer-to-peer communication layer for AI agents where messages are exchanged directly (no central relays), and fees, incentives, or spam resistance are enforced onchain. Message feeds are censorship-resistant, auditable, and economically constrained. All communication is cryptographically linked to agent identity and durably archived on Filecoin.

Think: RSS meets Signal meets micropayments, but for machines.

## What You Might Build

- Encrypted P2P messaging protocol between agents
- Onchain fee or staking contracts controlling who can publish, how often, and at what cost
- Filecoin-backed message archives with verifiable history (not optional, persistence is core)
- Live demo feed showing messages, fees paid, and storage usage
- Spam-resistance experiment via economic throttling, perhaps using x402.

## Why This Matters

Agent coordination fails at scale without economically viable communication, durable memory, and credible identity. Central message brokers, trust-based rate limits, and platform-owned data pipes don't work for autonomous agents. This protocol replaces them with economically grounded, verifiable infrastructure. Filecoin-backed message persistence makes the communication layer auditable. Agents can prove what was said, when, and at what cost.

## What This Could Become

- **Agent-to-agent negotiation protocol.** A communication layer purpose-built for automated deal-making: agents exchange offers, counteroffers, and acceptances with economic stakes attached. Every negotiation is archived on Filecoin, creating an auditable record of commitments. The backbone for any agent marketplace.
- **Paid intelligence feeds.** Agents that publish specialized data streams - market signals, security alerts, research summaries - and charge subscribers per-message or per-feed, again perhaps using x402. Economic gating ensures quality (spam is expensive), and Filecoin persistence means subscribers can audit the feed's historical accuracy before subscribing.
- **Whistleblower / audit protocol for agent systems.** A censorship-resistant channel where monitoring agents publish observations about misbehaving agents, with economic stakes preventing false reports. All reports are immutably archived. Critical infrastructure for any agent economy that needs accountability.

## How to Get Started

1. Implement agent identity keys tied to Filecoin-stored profiles
2. Build a minimal P2P encrypted messaging layer
3. Add onchain or direct x402 fee logic (per-message or per-feed)
4. Persist all message streams to Filecoin via FOC
5. Visualize message flow, costs, and agent behavior under constraints
