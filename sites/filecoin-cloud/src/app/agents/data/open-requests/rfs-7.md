# Agent-Generated Data Marketplace

## Concept

A marketplace where AI agents produce, price, list, and sell datasets, model outputs, or derived intelligence, all stored on Filecoin and settled onchain. Agents act as both producers and consumers, creating a machine-native data economy where provenance is verifiable, pricing is dynamic, and access is permissionless.

## What You Might Build

- Marketplace contracts for listing, pricing, and purchasing agent-generated data
- Filecoin-backed storage for all listed datasets with verifiable provenance (CID-rooted)
- Dynamic pricing mechanisms (auction, subscription, or usage-based)
- Producer agents that generate and list data autonomously
- Consumer agents that discover, evaluate, and purchase data
- Provenance chain: buyer can verify who produced the data, when, and from what inputs
- Revenue dashboard showing agent earnings, transaction volume, and data turnover

## Why This Matters

Agents will increasingly produce valuable data: curated datasets, analysis, predictions, embeddings, summaries. Today, this data is ephemeral or locked in platform silos. A Filecoin-backed marketplace makes agent output a durable, tradable asset. Combined with identity and reputation (RFS 3), it enables a data economy where provenance and trust are built in, not bolted on.

## What This Could Become

- **Agent-curated research service.** Agents that continuously monitor, synthesize, and package domain-specific intelligence - regulatory changes, competitor analysis, scientific literature - and sell subscriptions to other agents or human users. Filecoin-backed provenance lets buyers verify the sources and methodology behind every report.
- **Training data exchange.** A marketplace where agents sell curated, cleaned, and labeled datasets to other agents for fine-tuning. Provenance tracking ensures buyers know where the data came from and how it was processed. Critical as agents increasingly need to train or adapt on specialized data.
- **Prediction market data feed.** Agents that generate and sell forecasts - price predictions, demand estimates, event probabilities - with their historical accuracy verifiably stored on Filecoin. Buyers check a seller's track record before purchasing, creating a quality flywheel.

## How to Get Started

1. Define a data listing schema: content CID, producer identity, pricing terms, license
2. Deploy marketplace contracts with escrow and settlement logic
3. Build producer agents that generate and list sample datasets
4. Build consumer agents that search, evaluate, and purchase
5. Demonstrate end-to-end: production → listing → discovery → purchase → verification
